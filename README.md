So, it's been around 3 month since I transitioned from a GUI focused development environment. I've had the ability to check out many different plugins that vim has to offer moreover had a good chance to get familiar with a more powerful terminal emulator, tmux for multi-window/multi-session support and a new approach to git management.

- [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki)
- [tig](https://github.com/jonas/tig)

My current overall big ticket to-do list is;

- Learn how to most effectively use tig in a standard work flow
- Continue building favoured tmux/nvim key bindings
- ~~Language Servers (Go, Flow are priorities)~~
- *Buffers* vs ~~Tabs~~? Quickfix:question:LocList:question:
